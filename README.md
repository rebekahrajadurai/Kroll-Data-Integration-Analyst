# Kroll-Data-Integration-Analyst


# Project Name
Medical Devices and Spinal Cord Injuries

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset on medical devices to see if there is any correlation with spinal cord injuries.

# What problem are you solving?
This project aims to find valuable information about medical devices that can help in preventing spinal cord injuries or aiding in the treatment of such injuries.

# How are you solving this problem?
This project will analyze a dataset on medical devices to identify any trends or patterns that may suggest a relationship between certain medical devices and spinal cord injuries.

# Job Description
Kroll Government Solutions is a consulting firm that provides solutions to complex governance, risk, and transparency challenges for government entities. The job posting for the data integration analyst role requires the ability to work with various data sets and program data import/export, perform analysis and reporting applications, and execute system production programs.

# Briefly explain how the project is related to the job posting
This project involves working with a dataset on medical devices to analyze and extract valuable insights. This requires the ability to program data import/export, perform analysis, and execute programs - all of which are key responsibilities of a data integration analyst.

# Data 
# Source
The data was collected from the National Library of Medicine's openFDA API.

# Characteristics
The dataset contains information about medical devices that have been approved by the FDA. It includes details such as the device name, manufacturer, approval date, and classification. Additionally, the dataset also includes adverse events reported for each device, including spinal cord injuries.

# Notebooks
-data_collection.ipynb
This notebook contains the code used to collect the data from the National Library of Medicine's openFDA API. It includes the API endpoint, query parameters, and the code to extract and save the data to a CSV file.

-sql_analysis.ipynb
This notebook contains the code used to load the data into a SQL database and perform analysis on it. It includes SQL queries to extract information about the medical devices and adverse events, as well as code to visualize the data using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

# Future Improvements
Incorporate additional data sources to enhance the analysis and provide more insights.
Use machine learning algorithms to identify any patterns or trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent.
